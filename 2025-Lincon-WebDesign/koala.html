	<h2>About Koalas</h2>
<p>Koalas are adorable marsupials native to eastern Australia, famous for their round ears, large black noses, and cuddly appearance. Despite their resemblance to bears, they are not bears at all but are actually more closely related to wombats. Koalas primarily feed on eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most other animals, but koalas have a specialized digestive system that detoxifies the compounds. These nocturnal creatures sleep up to 18-22 hours a day to conserve energy, as their diet is low in nutrients and requires a lot of digestion time. Koalas spend most of their lives in trees, using their sharp claws to climb and grip onto the branches. Although they are solitary by nature, they communicate through a range of vocalizations, including a deep bellowing sound that can carry for miles. Unfortunately, koalas face threats from habitat loss, climate change, and diseases, making conservation efforts vital for their survival.</p>
