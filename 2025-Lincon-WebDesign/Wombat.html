	<h2>About Wombats</h2>
<p>Wombats are sturdy, burrowing marsupials native to Australia, known for their stocky build and short legs. They are nocturnal and spend most of their time in elaborate burrows, which they dig with their powerful claws to escape the heat during the day. Wombats are herbivores, primarily eating grasses, roots, and bark, and they have a highly efficient digestive system that allows them to extract the maximum amount of nutrients from their food. Remarkably, their feces are cube-shaped, which helps prevent the droppings from rolling away and marks their territory effectively. Wombats have thick, tough skin that protects them from predators and the harsh Australian environment. Though generally solitary, they communicate with each other through scent-marking and vocalizations. Despite their tough exterior, wombats are vulnerable to habitat loss and road accidents, making conservation efforts essential to preserving their populations.
