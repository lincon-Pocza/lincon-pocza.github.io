  <h2>About Kangaroos</h2>
<p>Kangaroos are one of Australia's most iconic animals, known for their powerful hind legs and unique hopping movement. They are marsupials, meaning they carry and nurse their young in pouches. There are four main species, with the red kangaroo being the largest, capable of growing up to 8 feet in length, including its tail. Kangaroos can reach speeds of over 35 miles per hour and jump as high as 3 meters (about 10 feet) in a single bound. They are herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses, and have evolved to survive in Australiaâ€™s harsh, dry environment by being able to go for long periods without water. Interestingly, kangaroos are also known for their social behavior, often gathering in groups called mobs, which help with protection and foraging.</p>
